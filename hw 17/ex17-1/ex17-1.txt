char :: Char -> Parser Char
char c = satisfy (c==)

char c = satisfy (c==)

Using prefix notation for the == function, this is the same as,

char c = satisfy ((==) c)

Now, using the definition of function composition, f (g x) = (f . g) x, this is the same as,

char c = (satisfy . (==)) c

Eta-reducing the c, this is the same as,

char = satisfy . (==) 

which is what we want.
