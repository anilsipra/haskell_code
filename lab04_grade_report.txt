### Instructor Comments ###############


Great Job!


--- Style tips ---

You are missing a type declaration on filter1, filter2, map1, map2, and take1.

It's cleaner to leave whitespace around ==
Instead of "str=="", write "str == ""


Again, congratulations on a perfect lab!

On the Outer Pyre steps the three purest usurpers swore to their vile
pursuers they were no prey. The route was worse from the original form they
expected there as the live volcano nearby often erupts.

-- Input:

Now owl, your nest on the heights, the earth silent, the last star on the
fringe of the horizon, what hears your ear? The desire of your beak (and
heart) are rats, of course. You think eating rats is the highest art. So
you reside there, over me, and listen. I should be asleep, but my own ears
are covered by headphones. Finger on tablet, I do battle! Don't eat me,
I'm not a rat. But there are worse evils. Because even if you ate me, it'd
be okay--I have three lives left. Wait, no, I just won! Nevermind. Please
don't eat me.


-- Output:

are, ear
art, rat
asleep, please
ate, eat

$ echo itisappropriatetostartthestudyofmathematicallogicbyinquiringwhatmathematicallogicis | ./WordSegmenter
You did something is wrong


-- Expected:

it is appropriate to start the study of mathematical logic by inquiring what mathematical logic is

-- Jaccard similarity of actual to expected word set: 0.058823529411764705  (1.0 = perfect)




$ echo everyartandeveryinquiryandsimilarlyeveryactionandpursuitisthoughttoaimatsomegoodandforthisreasonthegoodhasrightlybeendeclaredtobethatatwhichallthingsaim | ./WordSegmenter
CRASH OR INFINITE LOOP OR TOO SLOW!!!


-- Expected:

every art and every inquiry and similarly every action and pursuit is thought to aim at some good and for this reason the good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things aim

-- Jaccard similarity of actual to expected word set: 0.0  (1.0 = perfect)
